# MySQL and MariaDB story

### Monty Widenius, creator of MySQL and MariaDB

## Origin of MySQL

Lots of travelling and meeting interesting people. Combined with working from home, things were good. 2 people to 15 people. There were some growing pains... Then we found some strange company and it was scary but we found someone that can take over.

## Origin of Maria

Charm is not enough, can we succeed next time. All the original creators at there.
