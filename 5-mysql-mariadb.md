# MySQL and MariaDB story

### Monty Widenius, creator of MySQL and MariaDB

## Origin of MySQL

Lots of travelling and meeting interesting people. Combined with working from home, things were good. 2 people to 15 people. There were some growing pains... Then we found some strange company and it was scary but we found someone that can take over.

## Origin of Maria

Charm is not enough, can we succeed next time. All the original creators of MySQL are there.

## History

Most of the original MySQL engineers left before Sun was bought by Oracle and started to work on MariaDB. So MySQL was the first bit of free software they produced out, with dual licensing to allow full time work. Profitable in 2 months. Challenges of growing... Up to 1999 it was all small progress and a lot of things were done. About 30,000 support emails sent getting MySQL popular. In 1999 offer of $50M, but not taken yet. Spent 5 years developing MySQL to make it "good enough".

Started to take in investors to drive the company forwards. Choices:

- Continue
- Sell
- Take in investors

Last one was the best option.

Then Sun happened. You get money but loose control. Internal decision was to go public in 2008. Eventually it was decided to sell it to Sun to avoid closing the source. (Ha!)

## Now MariaDB

This is now a fork of MySQL. Developed by Monty Program Ab, which doesn't own the MariaDB project. It's a full hacking business model with the company owned by the company and is purely techincal and high level consulting. This is to ensure that MySQL of a form is available for free forever. Get a community developed and maintained brach, and share the code with other forks.

SkySQL is a strategic partner who provide support/hosting. Purpose isn't to remove all of the MySQL stuff.

MariaDB is a MySQL fork with a GPL-only license. It's basically the same thing. Public license. A huge number of new features in a few years, which haven't (and will probably never) end up in MySQL itself.

> Note: As we all know, MySQL is a big pile of suck, this goes some way to solving the mess and moving into the future, things like cross connections with Cassandra and a ot of other nice features.
