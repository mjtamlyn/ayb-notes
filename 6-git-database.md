# Git: The NoSQL database

### Brandon Keepers, Github

## 2 million years ago...

A revolution! We invented tools. And that's awesome. Now other animals do that, but we started to *develop* our tools to make them better and we reused and improved and taught.

## Git

It's amazing at storing code. How is it for data? Developed gaskit.

Disclaimer: NoSQL is marketing bollocks. Non-relational and often schema-less.

1. Git as a data store
2. Features
3. Anti-features

## Data store

`$ man git > the stupid content tracker`

So, how do we store data in it? The naive way is to create a repo and dump things in files, and commit them.
