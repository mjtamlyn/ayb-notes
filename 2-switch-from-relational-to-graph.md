# Switching from the relational to the graph model

### Luca Garulli, creator of OrientDB

So why do RDBMS users not want NoSQL? They're great for big data and big scale, but what about the *model*. What is the NoSQL answer to this? KV? Colunms? Document? **Graph!**

**CAUTION**. This will not show the classic paradigm of friend^n, we'll look at CRMs.

So everyone understands RDBMS, but who knows graph? Time for a crash course!

## Graph theory

- Vertices and edges, and edge connects to vertices
