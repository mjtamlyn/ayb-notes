# Redis, Steady, Go!

### Peter Cooper, publisher, programmer and author

Redis is pretty! That's the plan.

Antirez wrote it.

## What is Redis?

Remote dictionary server (or hash server). It's a data structure server? But... No 'tables', SQL, enforced relationships... Lots of 'primitives'. It's just keys and values!

Let's store some strings...

`SET A = 'hello' - > GET A`

Like an assembly language.

So Redis is a DSL for abstract data types. Open source, from 2009. Full time dev from 2010. It's basically memcached++ - more commands, presistence, data types and more.
